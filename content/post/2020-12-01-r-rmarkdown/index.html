<h1>Anime Recommendation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the website about anime recommendation !</p>
<p>The Shiny App we have created for this project concerns an anime recommendation based on these parameters:</p>
<p>- age of the person</p>
<p>- preferred anime genre (action, fantasy, etc.)</p>
<p>- time available to watch the anime</p>
<p>These different parameters will give a recommendation of an anime name.</p>
<div id="example-of-how-to-use-the-application" class="section level3">
<h3>Example of how to use the application</h3>
<p>Let’s take the example of a 15 years old person, who likes fantasy and comedy anime and has 30 minutes to watch an episode. This person will first write his/her age, then the two genres he/she likes (Comedy, Fantasy) thanks to the drop-down menu offered by the application. Then, she will take the cursor and indicate “30” in the time available per minutes.</p>
<p>We will then notice that Naruto will appear first as a recommendation. This seems plausible, since Naruto is an anime mainly aimed at children and teenagers. Moreover, each episode of Naturo lasts between 20 and 30 minutes.</p>
